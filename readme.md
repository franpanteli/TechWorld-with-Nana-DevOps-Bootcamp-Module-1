# TechWorld-with-Nana-DevOps-Bootcamp-Module-1
## Repository Contents
This repository contains my work for the first module in [TechWorld with Nana's DevOps Bootcamp](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp). This was completed as part of my independent learning, to invest in my DevOps skills. This introduction outlined the necessity of DevOps in the context of software testing and deployment, as well as the contrast between waterfall and agile methodologies for releasing application features. A [txt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franpanteli/TechWorld-with-Nana-DevOps-Bootcamp-Module-1/refs/heads/main/TWN%20DevOps%20Module%201%20Study%20Notes.txt) containing module notes was first written and a [word cloud](https://wordart.com/) of this generated.

### Notes Summary
	-> Applications are written, and when this is the case, there are developers who write changes to the code 
	-> There are also operations, who release these features to the general public (in most cases)
	-> Developers write the new feature, and operations release them 
	-> The feature release can happen in a waterfall approach (the business people write about the features they want, and then this is released all in one), or in an agile approach 
	-> Releasing features in an agile approach means that DevOps tools are used to automate the process of feature release
	-> Instead of developers writing a new feature and then writing instructions for operations on how to release this, there can be a DevOps pipeline so that this happens faster
	-> Monitoring tools can also be used to check release all or most of the time, so that instead of going from a waterfall approach (all of the changes at once), the changes to the code happen like a LaTex document being compiled 
	-> This is the process of compiling the changes to the features which the developers make to the features which the users see in the deployed application(s)
